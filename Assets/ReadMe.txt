Welcome to Shibui, our lo-fi renderer.

In the project directory,
Toon Shader folder contains the Shader Graph for the toon shader and a Custom Lighting HLSL script that was provided by Unity.

All folders ending with * Scene are the the modeled scene.
For example, double click on the folder titled "Cup Scene" and then again double click on the "Cup Scene" Unity project scene icon to open the scene.

Switch to the "Game" mode from Scene mode on the top and select the camera aspect ratio from "Free Aspect" to 1:1 (1000x1000 pixels for better resolution).

To experiment with the scene, click on any material in the Assests > * Scene folder and to the right, a menu with customizable parameters such as Lit Color, Shaded Color, Color Spread, etc. should open up.

In the Project Hierarchy menu on the left, click on the "Camera" object and to the right parameters to control the rotation and position of the camera should open.

Once satisfied with the angles and lighting, press the "Play" button on the top to get the final render.
